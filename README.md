# Ecom Time-To-Purchase Analysis

## Project Objective

The objective for this project was to present an analysis, insights and presentation based on ecommerce data depicting how much time it takes for a user to make a purchase on the website. The final visualisation should show the duration dynamic on a daily basis. 

**Questions this project aimed to answer:**
1. What share of our customers do complete their purchase within the same day?
2. How long does it take for a user to make a purchase after arriving to the Google Merchandise Store on the same day?
3. How long time does it take for users to complete a purchase when not done on the same day?
4. Who are the users making a purchase the same day vs. at a later stage? Can we see any differences and draw insights from that?
